Get all shipments
-----------------

* `GET /shipments` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of shipments belonging to the client sorted by most recently created shipment first.

_Optional parameters_:

* `batch_id` (integer) - when set return shipments that belong to the given batch.

* `from_date` (date) - when set return shipments with a `created_at` on or after the given date.

* `limit` (integer) - number of records to return per page (default is 100).

* `page` (integer) - pagination page number (default is 1).

* `q` (string) - allows for full text searching of shipments by `shipment_id`, `to_address_name`, or `order_id`.

* `status` (enum) - allows for searching shipments based on the following states:
  * `canceled` - the shipment has been canceled to prevent delivery and will either be held at a branch or returned to the client.
  * `pending` - the shipment is in the process of being created by the client. Shipments in this state cannot be received by Chat Chats.
  * `ready` - the shipment is ready to be received by Chit Chats. This means the postage has been purchased or provided.
  * `in_transit` - the shipment is in the process of being delivered. The following three statuses can be used to filter with greater detail:
    * `received` - the shipment has been received by Chit Chats.
    * `released` - Chit Chats has released the shipment to the carrier.
    * `inducted` - shipment is confirmed by tracking event to be in possesion by the shipping carrier.
  * `resolved` - the shipment has been resolved. The following three statuses can be used to filter with greater detail:
    * `delivered` - resolved as delivered.
    * `exception` - resolved as exception meaning that there may have been a problem deliverying the shipment. It doesn't always mean the shipment was not delivered.
    * `voided` - resolved as voided because a postage refund was requested.

* `to_date` (date) - when set only return shipments with a `created_at` greater than or equal to the given date.

Delete a shipment
-----------------

* `DELETE /shipments/abcde12345` will delete the pending shipment with the given ID if allowed. If the shipment has purchased postage or has been received by Chit Chats the shipment cannot be deleted but it can be refunded to void the shipment. No parameters required. Returns `204 No Content` if successful.

* insurance_requested - `true` or `false`

Buy shipment
------------

* `PATCH /shipments/abcde12345/buy` will attempt to buy the selected postage for the given shipment. Returns `200 OK` if successful.  A successful result only means that a purchase is requested.  The status of the shipment may be `postage_requested`.  If this happens the caller will need to wait a few seconds and poll until the shipment returns `ready` or `postage_purchase_failed`.

You can optionally pass the `postage_type` to select the rate.  Refer to the postage_types values returned by the `rates` array in the shipment details.

The reason for not blocking is that buying postage can take a few seconds (exact duration is dependent on our postage providers but this will normally complete in less than 3 seconds).  Because of the delay waiting to return for each call, is inefficient when buying 1000s of shipments. In this case, we recommend calling the buy end point on all your endpoints and then poll at reasonable intervals until the shipment's status changes to `ready`.  The example below shows how to accomplish this.

```ruby
def buy
  patch(:buy)

  # Buying postage can take a few seconds to process and generate a label
  # so block and poll until we know it doesn't fail.
  sleep(0.5) while reload.status == "postage_requested"
  raise "Purchase postage failed" if status == "postage_purchase_failed"

  status
end
```
