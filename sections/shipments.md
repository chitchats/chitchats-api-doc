Get all shipments
-----------------

* `GET /shipments` will return a [paginated list][pagination] of shipments belonging to the client sorted by most recently created shipment first.

_Optional parameters_:

* `batch_id` (integer) - when set return shipments that belong to the given batch.

* `from_date` (date) - when set return shipments with a `created_at` on or after the given date.

* `limit` (integer) - number of records to return per page (default is 100).

* `page` (integer) - pagination page number (default is 1).

* `q` (string) - allows for full text searching of shipments by `shipment_id`, `to_address_name`, or `order_id`.

* `status` (enum) - allows for searching shipments based on the following states:
  * `canceled` - the shipment has been canceled to prevent delivery and will either be held at a branch or returned to the client.
  * `pending` - the shipment is in the process of being created by the client. Shipments in this state cannot be received by Chat Chats.
  * `ready` - the shipment is ready to be received by Chit Chats. This means the postage has been purchased or provided.
  * `in_transit` - the shipment is in the process of being delivered. The following three statuses can be used to filter with greater detail:
    * `received` - the shipment has been received by Chit Chats.
    * `released` - Chit Chats has released the shipment to the carrier.
    * `inducted` - shipment is confirmed by tracking event to be in possesion by the shipping carrier.
  * `resolved` - the shipment has been resolved. The following three statuses can be used to filter with greater detail:
    * `delivered` - resolved as delivered.
    * `exception` - resolved as exception meaning that there may have been a problem deliverying the shipment. It doesn't always mean the shipment was not delivered.
    * `voided` - resolved as voided because a postage refund was requested.

* `to_date` (date) - when set only return shipments with a `created_at` greater than or equal to the given date.
